**Preliminary EDA: Project Cyber Security Attack Type Detection**
This notebook presents an initial exploratory data analysis of the raw cybersecurity attack dataset while the DE team handles data cleaning and preprocessing. The dataset contains 25 metrics and approximately 40,000 rows. Since the data is uncleaned and imperfect, the focus is on obtaining a first view of attack types, ports, and severity, and identifying preliminary feature importance among the 25 metrics. The analysis will be refined once the cleaned dataset is provided by the DE team.

⚠️ Findings are preliminary and may change once the DE team completes cleaning and feature encoding.

Purpose:
- Understand data structure
- Identify quality issues
- Form early feature hypotheses
